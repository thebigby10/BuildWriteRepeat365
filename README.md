# BuildWriteRepeat365

For the next 365 days, I'm going to write, code, build, debug, develop or do anything on the repo. The condition is I must commit something meaningful each day for a numeric year.

### Things on checklist-

    1. Develop a game
    2. Implement DS and Algos
    3. Build Projects
