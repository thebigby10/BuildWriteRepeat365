# BuildWriteRepeat365

For the next 365 days, I'm going to write, code, build, debug, develop or do anything on the repo. The condition is I must commit something meaningful each day for a numeric year. This repo will be archieved on 02-06-26 with all the code begin merged on the main branch.

I will also work on other repos too. But I'll post a note on this one. This will be considered a meaningful commit too.

### Checklist-
1. Explore
2. Build a game
3.
