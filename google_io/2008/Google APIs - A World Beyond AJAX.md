üîë Main Idea:

Google introduced a RESTful interface to access its APIs without JavaScript, allowing broader use in mobile apps, Flash/Silverlight, server-side apps, and restricted environments like Facebook FBJS.
üß∞ Key APIs Covered:

    Google Ajax Search API

        Access web, image, video, news, and blog search.

        Supports features like face detection and site-specific search.

        Used by sites like Kayak and RollingStones.com.

    Google Ajax Feed API

        Load and discover RSS/Atom feeds.

        findFeed and lookupFeed help locate relevant feeds.

        Powers tools like blogrolls and slideshows.

    Google Ajax Language API

        Translate and detect languages.

        Example: Mibbit.com for real-time chat translation.

üåê RESTful Interface Highlights:

    HTTP-based, read-only access to APIs.

    Returns JSON (lightweight, widely supported).

    Can be used in non-JavaScript environments like:

        Flash/Flex (with crossdomain.xml)

        Mobile apps

        Server-side apps (e.g., Python on App Engine)

    Example endpoint:
    https://ajax.googleapis.com/services/search/web?v=1.0&q=example

üß† Important Tips:

    Set Referer header to avoid abuse flags.

    Use API keys (optional but recommended).

    Has limits (e.g., 32 search results, 5000 chars translation).

üí° Real-World Uses:

    JSON-P for faster script loading on web pages.

    Flash apps (like a News Bar).

    Server-side Facebook apps using Google App Engine.

üìå Takeaway:

Google‚Äôs RESTful APIs allow developers to build richer, faster, cross-platform apps without needing JavaScript, unlocking powerful capabilities for web, mobile, and backend applications.

## Still related?
The Google Ajax APIs discussed in the 2008 presentation (Search, Feed, Language APIs via RESTful interface) are mostly deprecated or discontinued today. Here's the current status:
üî¥ Deprecated or Discontinued APIs:

    Google Ajax Search API

        ‚úÖ Deprecated. Replaced by:

            Custom Search JSON API ‚Äî still available but limited and requires an API key.

            Google Search is no longer freely available for arbitrary queries from non-Google UIs.

    Google Ajax Feed API

        ‚ùå Discontinued (as of 2016).

            Google officially shut it down.

            Developers now use alternative services (e.g., Feedly API, RSS parsers like Feedparser in Python).

    Google Ajax Language API

        ‚ùå Deprecated.

            Replaced by the Cloud Translation API, which is paid and more powerful, part of Google Cloud.

üü¢ What Still Exists (Modern Alternatives):
Original API	Modern Equivalent	Notes
Ajax Search API	Custom Search JSON API	Requires setting up a CSE (Custom Search Engine).
Ajax Feed API	No direct Google alternative	Use third-party or self-hosted RSS parsers.
Ajax Language API	Cloud Translation API	Advanced features, supports many languages, paid.
üß≠ Summary:

The ideas in the 2008 talk were very relevant at the time, especially the RESTful approach and JSON format. But today:

    These specific APIs are mostly outdated.

    Modern Google APIs exist with stricter access, authentication (API keys, billing), and focus on Google Cloud Platform.

If you're building something today, look at Google Cloud APIs or alternatives (like open-source or third-party services) depending on your use case.
